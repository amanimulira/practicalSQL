The SQL code creates a database schema for managing transactions, customers, employees, items, promotions, and their relationships. 
It also creates several views to query and analyze data from this schema. 

Here's a summary of the code and what it does:

Database Schema Creation:

Customers: Stores customer data including birthdate, first name, last name, 
and a unique customer ID (c_id).

Employees: Stores employee data similar to customers with a unique employee ID (e_id).

Transactions: Records transactions made by employees for customers. 
It includes references to employee and customer IDs and the transaction 
date, along with a unique transaction ID (t_id).

Promotion: Describes promotions offered in the store, including the 
number of items to buy, the number of free items, and a promotion type.

Items: Stores information about items available for sale, including 
price, type, amount in stock, and item name.

ItemsInTransactions: Represents the items purchased in each transaction. 
It includes references to item name and transaction ID, along with a 
unique ID for each item in a transaction (iit_id).

Views Creation:

LouisTransactions: Provides the count of transactions made by an employee 
named Louis Davies in September 2022.

PeopleInShop: Lists people (employees and customers) present in the shop 
on September 28, 2022, by their birthdate, first name, and last name.

ItemsLeft1: Calculates the remaining quantity of items of type 1 after transactions. 
It groups items by name and type and calculates the remaining stock.

ItemsLeft2: Similar to ItemsLeft1 but calculates the remaining quantity of items of type 3 or 4.

IITRanking: Ranks items in transactions based on the item ID, transaction ID, item 
type, price, and count of items. This is useful for analyzing transaction data.

TransactionCost: Calculates the total cost of each transaction by summing the 
prices of items purchased, considering promotions based on item types.

In summary, this SQL code creates a database schema for managing transactions in 
a store, along with views to analyze and extract useful information from the data. 
It utilizes relational database concepts such as foreign keys and joins to establish 
relationships between entities and tables. Additionally, it employs SQL views to 
provide convenient ways to query and analyze the data within the schema. 
The associated frameworks/modules used are SQL-based database management 
systems MySQL.
